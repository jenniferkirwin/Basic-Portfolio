            <p>Hello, my name is Jen. I am a marketer turned web developer, living in New Hampshire and making embroidery art in my spare time.</p>

            <p>At the start of my career I was a self-taught front-end developer, building websites from scratch with HTML and CSS and managing AdWords and digital marketing campaigns for a marketing agency. When I moved to Boston I landed a marketing job. Over the next 3 years of marketing, the companies I worked for underwent website redesigns and database updates. I saw what the developers were creating and said to myself, “this is good, but I can make an even better website”. When my husband and I moved back to New Hampshire recently, I decided to pursue web development once again.</p>
                
            <p>To help jumpstart myself, I am taking a class to better understand back-end development and build my portfolio once again. <a href="portfolio.html">Check out my latest projects here!</a> Want to chat? <a href="contact.html">Feel free to contact me at any time!</a> Like art? <a href="https://www.jenniferlamontagne.com/" target="_blank">Check out my embroideries at www.jenniferlamontagne.com.</a></p>
